    Commands

    commands:
     broadcast:
      description: Broadcast a msg
      default: op
     bgod:
      description: Broadcast msg as God
      default: op
     bhero:
      description: Broadcast msg as herobrine
      default: op
     announce:
      description: Broadcast announce msg
      default: op
     server: 
      description: Broadcast msg as server
      default: op
     console:
      description: Broadcast msg as console
      default: op


As of right now the default permission of for ops and specific permissions have not been set but I will add it in the future

Also I hope to add configurable messages as well in config for example


    bgod-prefix: [GOD]
    bhero-prefix: [HEROBRINE]



I also hope to add the ability to change the color for example


    bgod-color: §b
    bhero-color: §a


I will also possible add better coding and more features in later releases
