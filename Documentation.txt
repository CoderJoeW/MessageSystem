This is MessageSystem

The goal is to create a fun plugin with lots of cool ways to send out messages!

As of right now the messages available for use are

[PHP]
Usage:
/announce <msg>
/server <msg>
/console <msg>
/broadcast <msg>
/bgod <msg>
/bhero <msg>
/bcia <msg>
[/PHP]

Commands
[PHP]
commands:
 broadcast:
  description: Broadcast a msg
  default: op
 bgod:
  description: Broadcast msg as God
  default: op
 bhero:
  description: Broadcast msg as herobrine
  default: op
 announce:
  description: Broadcast announce msg
  default: op
 server: 
  description: Broadcast msg as server
  default: op
 console:
  description: Broadcast msg as console
  default: op
[/PHP]

As of right now the default permission of for ops and specific permissions have not been set but I will add it in the future

Also I hope to add configurable messages as well in config for example

[PHP]
bgod-prefix: [GOD]
bhero-prefix: [HEROBRINE]

[/PHP]

I also hope to add the ability to change the color for example

[PHP]
bgod-color: §b
bhero-color: §a
[/PHP]

I will also possible add better coding and more features in later releases
